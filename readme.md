# Basic GRPC vs HTTP/JSON

## Description
The purpose of this project is for learning and demo in a Kubernetes Medell√≠n MeetUp.

In this project you can compare the speed between call a gRPC service and a HTTP request to send a base64-image.

**This is not a benchmark, is just a test comparing both ways to consume microservices**
